1.  **Data flow**

| Input files | Output files |
|-------------|--------------|
| node.csv    | agent.csv    |
| link.csv    |              |
| trace.csv   |              |

File node.csv gives essential node information of the underlying (subarea)
network in GMNS format, including node_id, x_coord and y_coord.

File link.csv provides essential link information of the underlying (subarea)
network, including link_id, from_node_id and to_node_id. In the current version,
a straight line is assumed to connect from node and to link of each link without
requiring the geometry field.

File trace.csv descripes trajectory location points of each agent. The timestamp
format used here is hhmm:ss. In the future, we can also use DTALite

File agent.csv is the output file of the program. A most-likely path is given
for each agent based on input trajectories.
